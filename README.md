## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

EngiDocs lets you get the required notes, videos and pyqs based on the year , stream and subject you choose. Then it extracts the given pdfs from the site and redirects you into TL;DR , a summariser tool. It then fetches you answers based on your query to promote smart learning.

If the given question is not related to the pdf uploaded in the summariser, it gives an error message and asks you to chat with it related to the pdf uploaded.
